											<h3>Our Mission</h3>
										</header>
										<p>We are highschool students very passionate about closing the gender gap between men and women in STEM related fields, namely computer science. We came together to create no-tuition web development programs for middle school girls in the tri-state area, to encourage women from a young age, and to teach them to conquer the ultimate super power: coding. During the duration of the "crash courses" we would like to teach the girls markup languages like HTML5 and CSS3, as well as a brief introduction to the more complex, object-oriented programming language of javascript if time permits. By the end of the each program, the girls will have all skills necessary to create a dynamic, interactive and functional web application. Please feel free to contact us for further information, or to find ways to get further involved because encouraging women to code is something we feel our world really needs to see, and taking the initiative to build this camp seems to be the best way to break the preexisting stereotype that limits females daily.</p>
